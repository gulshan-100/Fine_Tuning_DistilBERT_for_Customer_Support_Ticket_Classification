# Customer_Ticket_Classification_with_DistilBERT
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the DistilBERT model for text classification. The aim is to classify customer support tickets based on their content using a labeled dataset.

### Project Overview

* **Model**: DistilBERT - a smaller, faster, and lighter version of BERT. 
* **Objective**: Classify customer tickets into predefined categories using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model.
* **Data**: CSV file containing text (body) and labels (tag_1)
